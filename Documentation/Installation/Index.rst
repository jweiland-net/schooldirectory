Installation
============

Composer
========

If your TYPO3 installation works in composer mode, please execute following
command:

..  code-block:: bash

    composer req jweiland/schooldirectory
    vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup --extension=schooldirectory

If you work with DDEV please execute this command:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev composer req jweiland/schooldirectory
    ddev exec vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup --extension=schooldirectory

ExtensionManager
================

On non composer based TYPO3 installations you can install `schooldirectory` still
over the ExtensionManager:

..  rst-class:: bignums

1.  Login

    Login to backend of your TYPO3 installation as an administrator or system
    maintainer.

2.  Open ExtensionManager

    Click on `Extensions` from the left menu to open the ExtensionManager.

3.  Update Extensions

    Choose `Get Extensions` from the upper selectbox and click on
    the `Update now` button at the upper right.

4.  Install `schooldirectory`

    Use the search field to find `schooldirectory`. Choose the `schooldirectory`
    line from the search result and click on the cloud icon to
    install `schooldirectory`.
