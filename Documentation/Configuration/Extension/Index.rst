==================
Extension Settings
==================

Some general settings for `schooldirectory` can be configured
in *Admin Tools -> Settings*.

Tab: Basic

poiCollectionPid
----------------

Default: 0

Only valid, if you have installed `EXT:maps2`, too.

While creating location records we catch the address and automatically create
a maps2 record for you. Define a storage PID where we should store these
records.
